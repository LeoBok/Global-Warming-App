        extendedParagraph: `
            Global warming is the rise in average temperatures across the globe, 
            which has been ongoing at least since record keeping began in 1880.
            Here are the bare numbers, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (opens in new tab): Between 1880 and 1980, 
            the global annual temperature increased at a rate of 0.13 degrees Fahrenheit (0.07 degrees Celsius) per decade, on average. 
            Since 1981, the rate of increase has sped up, to 0.32 F (0.18 C) per decade.
            Modern global warming is caused by humans. The burning of fossil fuels has released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, 
            which trap warmth from the sun and drive up surface and air temperatures.`,

        littleParagraph: "The effects of global warming are expected to be far-reaching and devastating.",
        extendedParagraph: `
            One of the most immediate and obvious consequences of global warming is the increase in temperatures around the world.
            As global average temperatures warm, weather patterns are changing in extreme weather behaviour.
            One of the most dramatic effects of global warming is the reduction in Arctic sea ice.
            Since the Industrial Revolution began in the early 1700s, the acidity of the oceans has increased about 25 percent, according to the EPA.
            Many species of plants and animals are already moving their range northward or to higher altitudes as a result of warming temperatures.`

        extendedParagraph: `
            Large sections of the Great Barrier Reef are already dead, and scientists warn that the rest of the coral organisms 
            that make up the sprawling reef ecosystem will die, if global warming continues unabated.
            After a yearof record-high-breaking temperatures in 2016, the Great Barrier Reef experienced
            its worst coral bleaching event on record, as the tiny coral animals evict their color-giving partners — algae
            that photosynthesize and are the reason for vibrantly hued reefs. `,

            Earth's climate has always been in a state of flux, according to data gleaned from the geological record, ice core samples and other sources.
            However, since the Industrial Revolution began in the late 1700s, the world's climate has been changing in a rapid and unprecedented way.
            The average global temperature has risen 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) since 1880. 
            Temperatures are projected to rise another 2 degrees to 11.5 degrees F (1.13 degrees to 6.42 degrees C) over the next 100 years`

            The fight against climate change (opens in new tab) is getting a big infusion of cash.
            The world's richest person, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, announced that he's starting an organization devoted to that pressing cause — and 
            he's putting in $10 billion of his own money to get it off the ground.
            The new Bezos Earth Fund "will fund scientists, activists, NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] — any effort that offers a real possibility to 
            help preserve and protect the natural world".
            "I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet," Bezos added. 
            "I'm committing $10 billion to start and will begin issuing grants this summer. Earth is the one thing we all have in common — let's protect it, together."`,
