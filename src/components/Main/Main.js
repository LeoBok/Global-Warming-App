            <p>
                In recent years, we have witnessed a rather worrying climate changes.
                This is the reason why we need to be careful and take care of our Earth.
                So I thought, it would be nice to have an app which you can monitor
                global warming data and I developed it.
                With this app you can check: temperature anomalies, methan, carbon dioxide and
                nitrous oxide levels and polar ice caps.
